At the first lesson of Computational Intelligence, i arrived early, chose my preferred seat, and decided to reserve it by placing a notebook on the chair as a placeholder.
Then, i went to get a coffee. When i returned, i noticed that the notebook had been moved and the seat was taken. I was about to get angrywhen Mahatma Gandhi,who was also
attending the course, placed a hand on my shoulder and offered me one of his finest pearls of wisdom, saying: "You know, the best kind of placeholder is your ass".
